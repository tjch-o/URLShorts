# URLShorts
A full stack URL shortener web app developed with the MERN stack. 

This is my first time using Chakra UI and MongoDB. I will look into deploying both the frontend and the backend soon.

Command to install all dependencies:
```
npm run update
```

Command to run both the frontend and backend:
```
npm run startApp
```
